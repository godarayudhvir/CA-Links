LittleLink is a lightweight DIY alternative to services like [Linktree](https://linktr.ee)
and [many.link](https://www.google.com). LittleLink was built using [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/), a dead simple, responsive boilerplate—we just stripped out some additional code you wouldn't need and added in branded styles for popular services. 😊

Using [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) let us build something that loads quickly & doesn't have any of the unnecessary bloat you would get from using a large framework for a page that requires nothing more than simplicity. LittleLink scored a 99/100 in performance when tested with [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse).

No need for gulp, npm, or anything else to make LittleLink work—it uses the bare essentials. You can automatically fork and deploy LittleLink with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Enjoy free and fast hosting with automatic deployments on every branch push with one click below. 👇️
